This week I discovered 2 really awesome browser-based tools called <a href="https://isartum.net/leimma" target="_blank">Leimma</a> and <a href="https://isartum.net/apotome" target="_blank">Apotome</a>, both created by <a href="https://khyamallami.com/" target="_blank">Khyam Allami</a> and <a href="https://ctpt.co/" target="_blank">Counterpoint</a>.

Leimma is used to play existing tuning systems or create microtonal custom ones. It has MIDI output possibility, which means you can connect it to your instruments or DAW. It comes with lots of cool features like reference pitch, Scala import, root note selection (with frequency input in Hz), solmization and more. You can either create a custom tuning system from scratch, or use an existing one and make changes from there.

Apotome is, on the other hand, a browser-based generative music environment based on octave-repeating microtonal tuning systems and their subsets (scales/modes). It has a very intuitive UI, and you can create different tracks and configure them separately. Each track can hold configurations such as:

* Tuning and subset with reference pitch
* Subset role weights
* Melodic intervals with polyphony option
* Octave weights
* Accents
* Beat division (including Euclidean!)
* Looping
* Note delay
* Staccato and legato
* Velocity range
* Instrument selection. Those were built <a href="https://www.webaudiomodules.org/" target="_blank">Web Audio Modules</a> web browser synthesizers. The following are available:
	* Basic synth (Sine, Sawtooth, Triangle and Square waves)
	* Karplus-Strong (string sythesis to simulate the sound of hammered or plucked string or some types of percussion)
	* OBXD (bank and preset selection) - based on the Oberheim OB-X.
	* DEXED (bank and preset selection) - based on the Yamaha DX7
	* Yoshimi (bank and preset selection)
	* MIDI out - possibility to send MIDI to external instruments or DAW.
	* 4 LFOs to control different properties.
	* Mixer

Leimma and Apotome work really well together, and you can create an account to save your tuning systems and sessions. I'm really looking forward to experimenting with those and sync my Apotome sessions to my modular synths setup.

Apotome is streaming live 24/7 from CTM Festival 2021, Jan 19 - Feb 14 with generative compositions, artist takeovers, a presentation, and a panel discussion. You can either <a href="https://ctm.isartum.net/" target="_blank">watch the stream</a> or <a href="https://isartum.net/apotome/booking" target="_blank">book your own performance</a>.
