6-channel 16-step Euclidean rhythm generator / sequencer, with a super intuitive design. That's how I would shortly describe the Euclidean Circles module (v1). It's the latest addition to my setup and I'm absolutely loving it. It's fun to experiment with and works very well for me when it comes to generating new patterns (simple and complex) which can lead to new ideas when composing.

I got it on ModularGrid's marketplace. At first it was a bit intimidating and not straightforward to operate, until I got hold of the official manual, <a href="/pdfs/manuals-sheets/EuclideanCircles_User_Manual.pdf" target="_blank" alt="Euclidean Circles v1 manual">EuclideanCircles_User_Manual.pdf</a>.

This nice Youtube review also helped me a lot.
